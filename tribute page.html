      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <ul id="overview">

          <ul>
            <li>C. R. Rao was the eighth of the ten children born to a Telugu Kamma family in Hoovina Hadagali, Bellary,
              Madras Presidency, Britain ruled India (now in Vijayanagara, Karnataka, India). </li>
            <li>His schooling was completed in Gudur, Nuzvid, Nandigama, and Visakhapatnam, all in the present state of
              Andhra Pradesh. </li>
            <li>He received an MSc in mathematics from Andhra University and an MA in statistics from Calcutta
              University in 1943.[5] He obtained a PhD degree at King's College, Cambridge, under R. A. Fisher in 1948,
              to which he added a DSc degree, also from Cambridge, in 1965.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><label id="list-head">Career: </label>
          <ul>
            <li>Rao first worked at the Indian Statistical Institute and the Anthropological Museum in Cambridge. Later
              he held several important positions, as the Director of the Indian Statistical Institute, Jawaharlal Nehru
              Professor and National Professor in India, University Professor at the University of Pittsburgh and Eberly
              Professor and Chair of Statistics and Director of the Center for Multivariate Analysis at Pennsylvania
              State University.</li>
            <li>As Head and later Director of the Research and Training School at the Indian Statistical Institute,
              India for a period of over 40 years, Rao developed research and training programs and produced several
              leaders in the field of Mathematics.</li>
            <li>Among his best-known discoveries are the Cramér–Rao bound and the Rao–Blackwell theorem both related to
              the quality of estimators.[13] Other areas he worked in include multivariate analysis, estimation theory,
              and differential geometry. His other contributions include the Fisher–Rao theorem, Rao distance, and
              orthogonal arrays. He was the author of 15 books[11] and authored over 400 journal publications.</li>
